<h1>About Keyboards</h1>
<p>Keyboards and pianos are beautiful and they will relax your mind and decrease the psychological stress...... Many Pianists have been playing the pianos in the Airport, Streets.etc to impress and attract us. Keyboards are veery sleek and awesome and are undescribable according to it's beauty. They are very much awesome to try with :)<br> I learnt keyboard in the age of 3 when i found it intresting... So, think creatively and play a keyboard in your sad, stressful times... it might be a partner for you and your soul....<br>😅Don't care about the resolution of background image please.. 😅<br> and also, let's look at some topics about it...</p>

<p>Now, the piano’s been around the block, tickling the ivories from Bach to Billy Joel. It’s got more range than my grandma’s mood swings and can play anything from a funeral march to a jingle that makes you want to buy a second vacuum cleaner.</p>

<p>Classical maestros like Beethoven made the piano famous, probably because he couldn’t hear himself play and just assumed it sounded awesome. And let’s not forget the jazz cats like Duke Ellington, who could make the piano purr, growl, and occasionally scratch the furniture.</p>

<p>In today’s world, the piano’s not just for the fancy folks in tails. It’s for anyone who’s ever wanted to express themselves but didn’t want to learn more than three chords. It’s the go-to for any musician who wants to show they’re serious by sitting down.</p>

<p>So, hats off to the piano, the instrument that’s been making family gatherings awkward since 1700. And a big shoutout to all the piano teachers out there, convincing kids that “Chopsticks” is a real song.</p>

<p>Thank you, and remember, behind every great pianist… is a very surprised cat.</p>
