<h1>Playing Keyboard<br> made fun.</h1>
<div class="sub-content">
<p>Keyboard is good for soul, mind<br> and gives peace.</p>
<p>As you can see, Keyboard is a key to motivational and inspirational medicine, which cares you with solitude and joy as you press the keys. From the old, Roman Piano age to, mordern studio Keyboards, there are many keyboards from their families. Lets take a look at them:-</p>
<h2> TYPES OF KEYBOARDS:-</h2>

<li>
<ul>Piano: Often referred to as the ‚Äúking of instruments,‚Äù the piano combines melody, harmony, and rhythm. Its strings are struck by hammers when keys are pressed, creating a wide tonal range and expressive dynamics.</ul>
<ul>Electric Keyboard: A versatile instrument that emulates various sounds, including piano, organ, and synthesizers. It‚Äôs commonly used in contemporary music.</ul>
<ul>Organ: Known for its majestic and powerful sound, the organ produces tones through air passing through pipes when keys are pressed. It‚Äôs commonly found in churches and concert halls.</ul>
<ul>Harpsichord: An ancestor of the piano, the harpsichord plucks strings with quills when keys are pressed. It has a distinct, bright sound and was popular during the Baroque era.</ul>
<ul>Clavichord: A delicate instrument where pressing keys directly strikes strings, allowing for subtle variations in volume and expression.</ul>
<ul>Celesta: Resembling a small upright piano, the celesta produces bell-like tones using metal plates struck by hammers.</ul>
<ul>Accordion: A portable instrument with a keyboard on one side and a set of bellows. It produces sound by vibrating reeds when keys are pressed.</ul>
</li>
<p>Remember, each of these instruments has its unique mechanism, historical context, and sonic qualities, but they all share the magic of keys as their primary means of control. üéπüé∂</p>
